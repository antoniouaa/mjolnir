## Formula

The formula used is derived from Bayes' theorem:

![Full equation](assets/fullEq.png)

Where:

- `Pr(S|W)` is the probability that a message is spam given that a word W is included in it
- `Pr(S)` is the overall probability that a message is spam
- `Pr(W|S)` is the probability that the word W appears in spam messages
- `Pr(H)` is this overall probability that a message is ham
- `Pr(W|H)` is the probability that the word W appears in ham messages

By assuming that the probabilities of a message being spam or ham are equal, we simplify the equation further

yields,

This is the exact equation used in the code to calculate the probability a word is spam or ham.
